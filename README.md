# VitaKot C++ Tools Library

A library with various utilities, nothing special, but used in most of my SW.

# Dependencies

Dependencies are not required when building the library, but must be linked in the target application/library if the corresponding
features of Better Enums, magic_enum and/or Nlohmann Json are used.
